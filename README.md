### Hey! I am Edmar ðŸ‘‹

I am a Brazilian software engineer with extensive experience working with startups across Europe, Australia, and the United States.
Throughout my career, I have helped to build products in diverse areas such as healthcare and research, payments, customer rate optimization, and mobility.



As a full-stack engineer, I am skilled in using a variety of technologies to build web platforms with different sets of API integrations.
Specifically, I have expertise in using Node.js, Django, and Java on the backend, and React and Angular on the frontend.


My experience includes building scalable systems that handle high volumes of data, optimizing application performance, and designing robust architectures.
I have also worked on implementing and integrating various third-party APIs such as Stripe, NMI, Spreedly, Survey Monkey, Twilio, Sendgrid, Sanity, and others.


Additionally, I have a passion for learning new technologies and keeping up with industry trends. 
I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and knowledge, and I am excited to take on new challenges and make meaningful contributions to innovative projects.
